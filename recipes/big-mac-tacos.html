    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Cup Whole Egg Mayonnaise</li>
        <li>2 tbsp finely chopped Pickles/gherkins</li>
        <li>1 tsp Dijon Mustard</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Ketchup</li>
        <li>1 tsp Onion Powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp Sweet Paprika</li>
        <li>1 tsp Onion Powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp Garlic Powder</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Beef mince</li>
        <li>Small Flour Tortillas</li>
        <li>8 Slice American Cheese</li>
        <li>2 Cups Shredded Lettuce (iceberg)</li>
        <li>Olive Oil Spray</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the sauce, add the ingredients to a small bowl, mix well to combine and set aside.</li>
        <li>To make the tacos, divide the beef mince into 8 equal portions. Working with one at a time, spread 1 portion of the beef mince over 1 tortilla, leaving a 0.5 cm or 1/4″ border around the edge. Repeat with remaining beef and tortillas.</li>
        <li>Heat a large frying pan over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle each beef-topped tortilla with salt and pepper right before cooking (do not add the salt and pepper until you are ready to cook, as it can make the beef tough).
        </li>
        <li>Spray the frying pan lightly with olive oil and then carefully place a tortilla in the frying pan, meat side down. Cook for 2-3 minutes, then flip and place a slice of cheese on top. Cook for a further 30 seconds. I normally cook two at a time. Repeat with remaining tortillas. Keep them warm in a 100°C/200°F oven if needed, or top them and serve immediately.</li>
        <li>Top each taco with lettuce, pickles and the burger sauce.</li>
    </ol>
